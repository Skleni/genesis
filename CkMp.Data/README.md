CkMp (.map) is the proprietary file format the SAGE engine by EA Games uses to save maps.
 
This library implements a .NET object model of the format to allow creation and editing of these maps.
 
The [Reader](https://github.com/Skleni/genesis/blob/master/CkMp.Data/Reader.cs) and [Writer](https://github.com/Skleni/genesis/blob/master/CkMp.Data/Writer.cs) classes can be used to convert between the binary file format and the object model.
